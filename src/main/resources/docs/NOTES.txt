netcheck script
================================================================================


The script is implemented in Bash script and uses Telnet command (TCP) for connection and port testing. One of the drawbacks of using telnet is that the 
command does not accept a timeout parameter to manage connections. Netcat ( or nc) command can achieve the same as telnet but I decided to use telnet because it is  more commonly available on most machines

=================
Data Validation
=================

The script performs validation of data ( and input file)

  a) It checks the input file, if the file can be read (permissions)
  b) It checks and delete space characters in the file
  c) It deletes any empty space in the file

======================
Checks done
======================

Checks done is not very exhaustive. They are:
  
  a) If machine and port connection succeed then move to the next entry
  b) If connection does  not succeed, then try ssh to server. If ssh succeeds, then  check if machine is listening on port
  c) If it is not then assert "Service not running".
  c) If ssh fails, check if it is DNS related or not
  d) Otherwise read telnet ouput message and use that as basis for decision

===================
Assumptions
===================
   a)  Telnet is enabled on local machine 
   b)  DNS lookup cannot be solely relied on. Host name provided could exist in /etc/hosts file or could be an IP.
   c)  Telnet command error message is used as last resort in determining cause of error

 
==============================
Improvements that can be made
==============================

1) Test if netcat or nc command ( or the like)  is available on the local machine and use that (since is easier to pass a timeout parameter) instead of telnet otherwise, use telnet.
2) The script does not check  the local host for any possible issue that may affect its connections. These may include firewall restrictions, configuration issues etc.
3) Find and alter Telnet configuration to reduce time-out value as this would improve script execution time.
